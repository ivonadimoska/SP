//Write a program that checks if a given year, read from the keyboard, is a leap year
//or not and prints an appropriate message.

//Examples of leap years: 
//1976, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012…

//Hint: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by4 but not
//divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.
